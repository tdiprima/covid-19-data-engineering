# COVID-19 Healthcare Data Engineering Pipeline

Critical healthcare data infrastructure built during the COVID-19 pandemic to process and analyze real-world patient data from HealtheIntent systems.

## üéØ Project Impact

**Built production data pipelines that processed COVID-19 healthcare data to support critical pandemic response efforts.** These systems handled real patient encounter data, medication records, and clinical observations from hospital systems during the height of the pandemic.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Multi-Database ETL Pipeline
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Üí **Vertica Data Warehouse** integration
- **HealtheIntent COVID datasets** processing (20+ medical data tables)
- **OHDSI OMOP** standard compliance for healthcare interoperability
- **Automated data type inference** and schema optimization

### Key Components

| Script | Purpose | Technical Highlights |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| `load_tables_daily.py` | Core PostgreSQL ETL Pipeline | Advanced type inference, backup/recovery, production error handling |
| `vertica_upload_daily.py` | Data Warehouse Integration | Multi-database connectivity, bulk loading optimization |
| `load_tables_daily_vert.py` | Advanced Vertica Processing | Enterprise-grade data warehouse operations, comprehensive logging |
| `vertica_upload_quart.py` | Quarterly Analytics Pipeline | Time-series data management, historical table archiving |

## üöÄ Key Technical Achievements

### 1. **Intelligent Data Type Inference** (`load_tables_daily.py`)
```python
def guessType(s):
    # Automatically detects optimal PostgreSQL data types
    # Handles: integers, numeric, boolean, date, timestamp, text
    # Production-tested on 20+ healthcare data tables
```

### 2. **Fault-Tolerant ETL Pipeline**
- **Atomic table operations** with backup/rollback capabilities
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed logging
- **Zero-downtime table switching** for production systems

### 3. **Enterprise Data Warehouse Integration**
- **PostgreSQL ‚Üí Vertica** data migration workflows
- **Bulk loading optimizations** for large healthcare datasets
- **Schema translation** between database systems

### 4. **Healthcare Data Standards Compliance**
- **OHDSI OMOP** common data model implementation
- **Healthcare data privacy** considerations
- **Clinical data validation** and quality checks

## üìä Data Processing Scale

- **20+ healthcare data tables** processed daily
- **Patient encounters, medications, procedures, conditions**
